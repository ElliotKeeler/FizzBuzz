# FizzBuzz
## A challenge I set myself to make an app in 48hrs _(9 a.m. ET 09/10/18)_


There are many things I would change, but it is what it is. Peppered throughout the code you might notice things I started and didn't get time to finish, though most I removed near the very end of the time limit.
I tried to comment and write clean code where I could.

## Blog post about the process:
Coming soon!

## Check it out on the app store:
Coming soon, but not as soon as the blog post!
